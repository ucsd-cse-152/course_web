        <h4>Syllabus</h4>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>

        <p>The goal of computer vision is to compute properties of the three-dimensional world from images and video.
            Problems in this field include identifying the 3D shape of a scene, determining how things are moving, and
            recognizing familiar people and objects. This course provides an introduction to computer vision, including
            such topics as feature detection, image segmentation, motion estimation, object recognition, and 3D shape
            reconstruction through stereo, photometric stereo, and structure from motion. To reflect the latest
            progress
            of computer vision, we also include a brief introduction to the philosophy and basic techniques of deep
            learning
            methods.</p>

        <p>Prerequisites: Linear algebra and calculus; data structures/algorithms; and Python or other programming
            experience.</p>

        <p>Programming aspects of the assignments will be completed using Python</p>

        <p>Academic Integrity Policy: Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University
            expects
            that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University
            intellectual work. In this class, we encourage students to form groups of two and work together on
            homeworks. This means
            that all academic work will be done by the pair of individuals to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized
            aid of any kind.</p>

        <p>Collaboration Policy: It is expected that you complete your academic assignments in your own
            words (more specifically, for any write-up assignment each individual must submit an independent copy). For
            coding tasks, each
            group can submit one copy together. The assignments have been developed by the instructor to facilitate
            your learning and to provide
            a method for fairly evaluating your knowledge and abilities (not the knowledge and abilities of others).
            So, to
            facilitate learning, you are authorized to discuss assignments with others (even if he/she is not your team
            member);
            however, to ensure fair evaluations, you are not authorized to use the answers developed by another, copy
            the work
            completed by others in the past or present, or write your academic assignments in collaboration with
            another person.</p>

        <p>If the work you submit is determined to be violating the rules, you will be reported to the Academic
            Integrity
            Office for violating UCSD's Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. In accordance with the CSE department
            academic
            integrity guidelines, students found committing an academic integrity violation will receive an F in the
            course.</p>

        <p>Late Policy: Assignments will have a submission procedure described with the assignment. Assignments
            submitted
            late will receive a 15% grade reduction for each 12 hours late (i.e., 30% per day). Assignments will not be
            accepted
            72 hours after the due date. If you require an extension (for personal reasons only) to a due date, you
            must request
            one as far in advance as possible. Extensions requested close to or after the due date will only be granted
            for clear
            emergencies or clearly unforeseeable circumstances. You are advised to begin working on assignments as soon
            as they
            are assigned. </p>

        <h4>Homework, Exams, and Grading (tentative)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Homeworks (4 assignments) 40% (10% per homework). </li>
            <li>The due dates of homeworks are at 11:59PM of Wed in the 3, 5, 7, and 9 weeks.</li>
            <!--<li>In-class exam 5%</li>-->
            <li>Mid-term 20%, in the Thu class of the 5th week</li>
            <li>Final 40% (TBD)</li>
        </ul>
